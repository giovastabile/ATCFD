# ATCFD

This repo contains some tutorials to run finite volume examples using the openfoam docker.

Before using the docker container you need to install docker into your system. 

[Here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) the instructions.



```
git clone https://github.com/giovastabile/CFD2024
```

Then:

```
cd ATCFD
chmod +x openfoam-docker
```

After that you can activate docker using the OpenFOAM folder.

```
./openfoam-docker -dir=OpenFOAM
```
